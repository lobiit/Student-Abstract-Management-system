# Studenst Abstract Management System
The project aims to address the tedious and time-consuming process of managing and controlling student final year projects using manual or classical methods. The goal is to develop an integrated framework to handle the storage and retrieval of these projects, providing a more efficient and effective solution. The framework will include features such as project submission, review, and approval, as well as the ability to search and access project materials. By automating these processes, the framework saves time and resources, and improves the overall management of student projects.
